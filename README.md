# springcloud-microservices-tolldata-alternate
Secondary repository for spring config server, in case the primary repo is not avaliable (secondary)  

**Note: You cannot create a folder inside your existing reposity and provide the path for the same as repositoty location,
as to serve the configuration it first clone/downloads the repository into your local and when you provide the path specific to folder
it will not be able to download the configurations and you will get "NoRemoteRepositoryException" 
hence, you have to create saperate repositoris**

## **Not a saperate project, just a helper for "springcloud-microservices".**
